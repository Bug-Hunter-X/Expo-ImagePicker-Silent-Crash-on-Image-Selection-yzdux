This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library. The error is thrown when selecting an image from the device gallery, and is particularly difficult to debug because it doesn't provide a clear error message.  The app crashes silently, without any informative console logs or error alerts. The issue appears to be related to how the image data is handled after selection, possibly due to memory management issues or incorrect image format processing.  This problem is intermittent; sometimes it works correctly, and sometimes it fails without any apparent change in the code or device state.
