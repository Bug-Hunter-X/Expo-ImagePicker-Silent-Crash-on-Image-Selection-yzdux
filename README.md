# Expo ImagePicker Silent Crash Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo ImagePicker library. The app silently crashes without providing useful error messages when selecting images from the device gallery. The crash is intermittent, making it challenging to diagnose.

## Bug Description
The ImagePicker component fails to handle image selection correctly, leading to unexpected app termination.  No console errors or user-friendly error messages are provided.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project using `expo start`.
3. Open the ImagePicker and attempt to select an image from the gallery.
4. Observe that the app sometimes crashes silently and other times works correctly.

## Solution
The solution involves adding thorough error handling to catch potential issues during image processing and providing better feedback to the user. This might include handling specific exception types or implementing asynchronous operations more gracefully.
